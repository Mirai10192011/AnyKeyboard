# SEO & Language Page Structure

AnyKeyboard uses language-specific pages intentionally.

Each page supports:
- A specific keyboard layout
- Speed writing features for that language
- Phonetic typing (where available)

---

## Why Separate Language Pages?

People search for:
- "French keyboard online"
- "Type Arabic online"
- "Japanese keyboard browser"
- "phonetic keyboard [language]"

Dedicated pages allow AnyKeyboard to match real search intent.

---

## Layouts ≠ Translation

Language pages are not translations of the same content.
Each page focuses on:
- A specific layout
- A specific typing intent

---

## Hreflang & Targeting

Language pages are designed to serve users looking for specific layouts, not
only native speakers.

For example:
An English-speaking user searching for a Finnish keyboard should still land on the
Finnish layout page.

---

## Scalability

This structure allows AnyKeyboard to scale to 100+ languages cleanly without
duplicate content.
