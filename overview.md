# Overview

AnyKeyboard.io is an online typing toolkit designed to make multilingual typing
simple, fast, and accessible.

It includes:
- A browser-based virtual keyboard with 100+ language layouts
- A speed writing utility to help you type faster across those languages
- Phonetic typing for major languages (type using familiar Latin letters and get the target script)

Typing special characters or non-Latin scripts often requires installing keyboard
layouts, changing system settings, or using unfamiliar tools. AnyKeyboard removes
that friction by working entirely in the browser.
