# Privacy & Security

Privacy is a core principle of AnyKeyboard.

The keyboard, speed writing utility, and phonetic typing are designed to work
without storing your typed text.

---

## What We Do NOT Do

- No keystroke logging
- No text storage
- No user accounts required for core typing
- No tracking of typed content
- No data selling

---

## Client-Side Only

All typing happens locally in your browser.
Text is never sent to AnyKeyboard servers as “typed content storage.”

---

## Cookies & Tracking

AnyKeyboard does not require cookies for core functionality.
If analytics are used, they should be strictly limited and never tied to typed content.

---

## Safe Use

You can safely use AnyKeyboard for:
- Personal writing
- Learning
- Work-related tasks

We strongly discourage typing sensitive information (passwords, credit cards)
on any third-party website, including this one.
