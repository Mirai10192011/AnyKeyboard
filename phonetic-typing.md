# Phonetic Typing

AnyKeyboard supports phonetic typing for major languages where it makes sense.

Phonetic typing means:
- You type using familiar Latin letters (based on sound)
- The tool outputs the target script

This is useful when you:
- Don’t know the native keyboard layout
- Want to type quickly without learning key positions
- Are a beginner learning a script

---

## Why Phonetic Typing Matters

Phonetic typing lowers the barrier to entry for scripts like:
- Arabic / Persian / Urdu
- Hindi and related scripts
- Russian
- Greek
- Other major non-Latin writing systems (depending on support)

## Important Note

Phonetic typing is not translation.
It does not change meaning — it changes how input is entered.

You still decide the words. The tool helps you type them.
