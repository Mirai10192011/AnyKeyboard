# How AnyKeyboard Works

AnyKeyboard runs entirely in the browser and does not require extensions,
downloads, or system-level changes.

It supports both:
- Standard keyboard layouts (native-style layouts)
- Phonetic typing for major languages (where supported)

It also includes a speed writing utility designed to make multilingual typing faster.

## Keyboard Layouts

Each language uses a dedicated keyboard layout that reflects how native speakers
type, not just a list of characters.

This includes:
- Letter positioning
- Accents and diacritics
- Special characters
- Script-specific layouts (e.g. Arabic, Japanese, Korean)

---

## Phonetic Typing (Supported Languages)

For major languages, AnyKeyboard can offer phonetic input:
you type using Latin letters and the tool produces the target script.

Example concept:
- Type what it sounds like → get the correct script output

(Exact availability depends on the language.)

## Speed Writing Utility

AnyKeyboard includes a built-in typing speed test that works across all supported
languages and layouts.

Users can:
- Practice typing using random sentences
- Track typing speed in WPM (words per minute)
- Measure real-time accuracy
- Practice in their chosen language or layout

This makes AnyKeyboard useful not only for typing text, but also for improving
typing speed and accuracy in foreign languages.

## Client-Side Typing

All typing happens locally in your browser.

- No keystrokes are sent to a server
- No text is stored
- No accounts are required

You type, copy your text, and paste it wherever you need.

---

## Desktop & Mobile

AnyKeyboard works on:
- Windows
- macOS
- Linux
- Android
- iOS

The interface adapts automatically to screen size and input method.

## Why Browser-Based?

A browser-based keyboard:
- Works on locked or shared devices
- Requires zero configuration
- Is always up to date
- Is accessible from anywhere

Open → Type → Copy → Done.
